# To-do-list-app
Introduction 
This web project combines To Do List and timer, users can enter the tasks planned to do and can delete the tasks when they are finished. According to the pomodoro method, taking strategic breaks can improve productivity, so in this project users can assign just one task to every 30-minute interval. During the interval, users can pause the countdown timer if necessary, but it is better to work without interruption for 30 minutes and take a 10-minute break.
I use Flask to build this to do list manager and SQLAlchemy to create a task's database. Besides, in order to create a  countdown timer with JavaScript.
